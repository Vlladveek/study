            <p class="nothing">
                A programming language is a formal language consisting of a set of instructions used to communicate with
                a
                computer and create software programs. These languages provide a structured way for humans to write
                instructions that a computer can understand and execute to perform specific tasks.

                JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language widely used for creating interactive and
                dynamic content on the web. It is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside
                HTML
                (which provides structure) and CSS (which provides styling).

                C++ language
            </h2>
            <p>
                C++ is a powerful, general-purpose programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension
                of the C language, incorporating object-oriented programming (OOP) features. It is a compiled,
                statically-typed language known for its high performance and control over system resources and memory.

            <h2>Java language</h2>
            <p>
                Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language and computing platform, initially released by
                Sun Microsystems in 1995 and now owned by Oracle. It is designed with the principle of "Write Once, Run
                Anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on any platform that supports Java without the
                need for recompilation. This is achieved through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which
                executes Java bytecode.

            <h2>Python language</h2>
            <p>
                Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum
                and first released in 1991, it is known for its emphasis on code readability and its use of significant
                indentation.
